# Bugs and Glitches

These are known bugs and glitches in the original Pokémon Gold and Silver games: code that clearly does not work as intended, or that only works in limited circumstances but has the possibility to fail or crash.

Fixes are written in the `diff` format. If you've used Git before, this should look familiar:

```diff
 this is some code
-delete red - lines
+add green + lines
```

All the bugs documented here were fixed in Pokémon Crystal. Any that weren't are already documented in [the pokecrystal repo](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/docs/bugs_and_glitches.md), so they're not duplicated here.

## Using the Coin Case can cause arbitrary code execution

([Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO3UplJNTO8YGl0na5FT_6dVYsC27D0rk))

**Fix:** Edit `_CoinCaseCountText` in [data/text/common_3.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokegold/blob/master/data/text/common_3.asm):

```diff
-; BUG: "done" is not a valid terminator here, needs to change to "text_end"
 _CoinCaseCountText::
 	text "Coins:"
 	line "@"
 	text_decimal wCoins, 2, 4
-	done
+	text_end
```


## The game can incorrectly run in GB mode when this is a GBC

([Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-aK0sOXGdc), [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnvZXutzb1Y))

**Fix:** No fix is available at this time.


## Entering the Hall of Fame without a save file can corrupt the PC boxes

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxkQ7QdfdqM))

**Fix:** Edit `HallOfFame` in [engine/events/halloffame.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokegold/blob/master/engine/events/halloffame.asm):

```diff
-; Bug: Gold/Silver fail to (conditionally) erase the previous save and
-; initialize the current save, if the player did not save on this playthrough.
+	ld a, [wSavedAtLeastOnce]
+	and a
+	jr nz, .saved
+	farcall ErasePreviousSave
+.saved
```


## The Lucky Number Show does not find winning ID numbers in inactive boxes 10-14

**Fix:** Edit `CheckForLuckyNumberWinners` in [engine/events/lucky_number.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokegold/blob/master/engine/events/lucky_number.asm):

```diff
-	; BUG: fails to find winning mon in boxes 10-14 if not the active box
-	cp NUM_BOXES_JAPANESE
+	cp NUM_BOXES
 	jr c, .BoxesLoop
```


## Present's text overflows when it fails to heal an enemy Pokémon with a long name

**Fix:** Edit `PresentFailedText` in [data/text/battle.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokegold/blob/master/data/text/battle.asm):

```diff
-; BUG: Pokémon names 8-10 characters long can overflow the textbox,
-; printing as "Enemy 1234567890 can't": up to 21 characters, over 18.
 PresentFailedText:
-	text "<TARGET> can't"
-	line "receive the gift!"
+	text "<TARGET>"
+	line "refused the gift!"
 	prompt
```


## You can fish in the water in Cerulean Gym

**Fix:** Edit `MapGroup_Cerulean` in [data/maps/maps.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokegold/blob/master/data/maps/maps.asm):

```diff
-	map CeruleanGym, TILESET_PORT, INDOOR, LANDMARK_CERULEAN_CITY, MUSIC_GYM, TRUE, PALETTE_DAY, FISHGROUP_SHORE
+	map CeruleanGym, TILESET_PORT, INDOOR, LANDMARK_CERULEAN_CITY, MUSIC_GYM, TRUE, PALETTE_DAY, FISHGROUP_NONE
```


## "Route 15" is not capitalized in a signpost

**Fix:** Edit `Route15SignText` in [maps/Route15.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokegold/blob/master/maps/Route15.asm):

```diff
-	text "Route 15" ; should be "ROUTE 15"
+	text "ROUTE 15"
```

(There are many other text changes between Gold/Silver and Crystal, but they are more subjective edits, not definite corrections.)
