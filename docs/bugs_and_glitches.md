# Bugs and Glitches

These are known bugs and glitches in the original Pokémon Gold and Silver games: code that clearly does not work as intended, or that only works in limited circumstances but has the possibility to fail or crash.

Fixes are written in the `diff` format. If you've used Git before, this should look familiar:

```diff
 this is some code
-delete red - lines
+add green + lines
```

All the bugs documented here were fixed in Pokémon Crystal. Any that weren't are already documented in [the pokecrystal repo](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/docs/bugs_and_glitches.md), so they're not duplicated here.

(There are many other text changes between Gold/Silver and Crystal, but they are more subjective edits, not definite corrections.)
