# Pokémon Dark Gold and Dark Silver [![Build Status][ci-badge]][ci]

This is a Rom Hack based on the disassembly of Pokémon Gold and Pokémon Silver by Pret. There is no clear goal for this project at this time.
I wanted to learn about ROM hacking and assembly, as well as make something fun for my Friends and Family.
Many of the changes are based on things I wanted from a ROM Hack or my Friends or Family asked for.
You are more than welcome to give it a play, suggest changes, and propose code improvements. 
Please be nice, I literrally have no idea what i'm doing, this is purely for fun!
I will be using code obtained from other projects, I will try to include references on where code was obtained where possible to give credit.
I chose to use Gold/Silver, instead of crystal, because I wanted to find a way to keep the version differences and encourage trading/battleing with my friends/family.
I also made a janky "girlversion" branch, that will replace the main character with the female Kris sprites/Images. It was easier to do this than
adding a bunch of new code. 

The original disassembly builds the following ROMs:

- Pokemon - Gold Version (UE) [C][!].gbc `sha1: d8b8a3600a465308c9953dfa04f0081c05bdcb94`
- Pokemon - Silver Version (UE) [C][!].gbc `sha1: 49b163f7e57702bc939d642a18f591de55d92dae`
- mons2_gld_ps3_debug.bin `sha1: 53783c57378122805c5b4859d19e1a224f02a1ed`
- mons2_slv_ps3_debug.bin `sha1: 4c2fafebdbc7551f4cd3f348bdd17e420b93b6e7`
